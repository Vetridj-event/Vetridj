## 2. Detailed Strategy

### A. Node.js Hosting (VPS)
**Recommendation: RackNerd (Offers), Hetzner CLoud, or DigitalOcean (Basic)**
*   **Strategy**: To hit the <₹4.5k target, we must cap VPS spend at **$4/month**.
*   **Top Picks**:
    *   **Hetzner Cloud (CPX11)**: Excellent performance at ~€3.79/mo.
    *   **RackNerd**: Often has "Black Friday" style deals for ~$25-30/year (approx ₹2,500) if purchased annually.
    *   **DigitalOcean**: Basic Droplet at $4/mo (₹340/mo).

### B. Database (MongoDB)
**Recommendation: MongoDB Atlas (M0 Free Tier)**
*   **Why?**:
    *   **Cost**: Completely free forever.
    *   **Capacity**: 512MB storage (enough for thousands of bookings/users initially).
    *   **Scalability**: Can upgrade to M2 (~₹750/mo) only when traffic grows significantly.
*   **Backup Plan**: If M0 limits are hit, migrate to a self-hosted MongoDB on the VPS (saves M2 cost but uses VPS resources).

### C. WhatsApp API
**Recommendation: Meta Cloud API (Direct Integration)**
*   **Cost Structure**:
    *   **First 1,000 Conversations/Month**: **FREE**.
    *   **After 1,000**:
        *   Marketing (Promotions): ~₹0.80 per conversation.
        *   Utility (Booking updates): ~₹0.30 per conversation.
        *   Service (User initiates): ~₹0.29 per conversation.
*   **Why Direct API?**:
    *   Third-party tools (WATI, Interakt) charge monthly subscription fees (~₹2000+/mo) which would blow the budget.
    *   Direct integration only costs per message after the free tier.
*   **Requirement**: A valid Facebook Business Manager account and a credit card on file (charged only if limits exceeded).

## 3. Scaling Plan (If Budget Increases)

If the business grows and the ₹5.8k budget can be expanded:

1.  **Upgrade Database**: Move to MongoDB Atlas M2 (~₹9/mo) for automated backups and higher throughput.
2.  **Upgrade VPS**: Move to a $10-12/mo plan (2GB RAM) for faster speeds during peak wedding seasons.
3.  **WhatsApp Marketing**: Allocate a monthly budget (~₹500-1000) for proactive marketing campaigns beyond the free limit.

## 4. Immediate Action Items

1.  **Sign up for Railway/DigitalOcean**: Create an account and deploy the [main](file:///Users/barathvijay/Downloads/vetri-dj-booking-system/app/admin/finance/ledger/page.tsx#115-123) branch.
2.  **Configure MongoDB Atlas**: Ensure the M0 cluster is active and whitelisted for production.
3.  **Register Meta Developer Account**: Set up the WhatsApp Cloud API app and generate system user tokens.
4.  **Buy Domain**: Purchase the domain name and point DNS to the VPS.
